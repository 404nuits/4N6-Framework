## Notes
Hey guys,

I always loved OSINT framework and i was ashamed that there was no equivalent for digital forensic, so I created my own by forking the original project

I'll add more things based on my knowledge, so mostly Windows, and then I'll extend to other OS, but if you want to suggest a new node, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request

All the nodes are located in the arf.json file

Thank you!
